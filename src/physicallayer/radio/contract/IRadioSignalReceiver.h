/**
 * This interface represents a physical device (a part of the radio) which converts
 * electric signals into packets.
 *
 * The receiver interface supports optimistic parallel computation of reception
 * results. For this reason some functions are marked to be purely functional.
 * They are qualified with const and all of their parameters are also qualified
 * with const. Moreover they don't access any state that can change over time to
 * avoid non-deterministic behavior. These functions may be called from background
 * threads running parallel with the main simulation thread. They may also be
 * called several times due to cache invalidation before the actual result is
 * needed.

// TODO: it's probably better to split this interface and all other interfaces into two, one with state that changes over time
